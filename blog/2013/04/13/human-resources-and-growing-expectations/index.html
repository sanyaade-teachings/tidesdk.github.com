<div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK">TideSDK&#8217;s complex code base</a> has made it challenging to attract deep programming talent. Regardless of seemingly large open teams, most innovation and code for almost all open projects stem from a few people at its core. With TideSDK, this is no different.</p>

<p>There is a reality of working with software such as TideSDK that is written at a low level. What is that? On one side, our user base consists of web developers and JavaScript application developers. On the other, TideSDK’s sources require deep knowledge in various flavors of C++, python for our build systems, and a variety of scripting languages including Ruby, PHP and JavaScript. Advanced knowledge of each platform is also needed to establish and maintain tool chains, build software and systems. Becoming productive in the TideSDK sources requires a substantial investment in time together with these skills.</p>

<p>TideSDK is not a weekend hacker project, the effort of an itch to scratch, or the kind of software that one can come and go from easily. It requires dedication from folks strongly committed to progress. Expectations about fast moving progress must be tempered against the complexity of the project and the time its contributors can dedicate to it.</p>

<h2>How has this all been working?</h2>

<p>As can be imagined, we’ve been operating under extraordinary challenges and constraints over the past year. From idealistic beginnings, we wanted the outcome of our well intentioned open source efforts have a great public impact - an impact greater than a development subsidy resulting from the technical labor and skills from a few core contributors.</p>

<p>In fact, we anticipated and want broader code contribution. Our aspirations also included some measure of financial sustainability - enough to fund our core developers (at least part-time) and to provide the necessary resources for our team (to work together with other open code contributors) for a broad and public benefit.</p>

<p>To illustrate, more than 99% of the more than 1.35 million line changes contributed to our source code since TideSDK began were made by two people. This was the result of efforts exceeding full time hours over a extended period of time.</p>

<p>At some point over the past months, we began asking ourselves hard questions about sustainability in a harsh and realistic way (while we considered the human and financial inputs for the project). Practical decisions must be made in relation to these factors on the timing of deliverables for the project.</p>

<p>The general success of <a href="http://www.tidesdk.org/blog/2013/04/11/tidesdk-in-numbers">the last TideSDK release</a> has increased expectations for more releases with shorter release cycles. We are pleased that app developers are making great use of our software. Indeed, this is a strong motivator that has encouraged us greatly. We believe the work we are doing can help shape the future of software development. That’s why we remain excited about possibilities despite the challenges with our open source effort.</p>

<p>Community efforts are the fuel that propels open source. We are all human and can only proceed at a pace of the resources we can sustain for open source TideSDK. How quickly we progress is largely depends on your contribution.</p>

<h2>How to Contribute</h2>

<p>If you are interested in contributing or wish to get involved in TideSDK - read the sources and pick an issue in our <a href="https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/issues">issue tracker</a> on Github. When your code is ready to review, issue a pull request and we will review it. Documentation on how we manage our code and work is in our <a href="https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Beyond the core code, opportunities exist for anyone to contribute to documentation, guides, tutorials, examples or solutions to benefit the community. Other ways to contribute include answering questions on our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tidesdk">mailing list</a>, <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net#tidesdk">IRC channel</a>, or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tidesdk">stackoverflow</a> and to promote TideSDK (or a project you have created using TideSDK) on social channels  or a blog post.</p>
