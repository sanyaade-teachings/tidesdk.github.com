<div class="entry-content"><p>In the last few months simple facts and realities have shaped how we handle our work on <a href="http://tidesdk.org">TideSDK</a>. The level of effort, speed and progress on TideSDK is deeply dependent on the human and financial resources we receive.</p>

<h3>The good numbers</h3>

<p>Since the mid November 1.3.1-beta release, TideSDK was downloaded more than 46,000 times. This is approximately a six fold increase over previous three month period.</p>

<p>Traffic to our site grew substantially. At times this has reached 10,000 page views per day. TideSDK is just a single page website so these numbers are impressive and encouraging to us. More than 71,000 visits have been logged to TideSDK.org since Jan 1st with approximately 40% of visitors returning. In the same period, the <a href="http://tidesdk.multipart.net/docs/user-dev/generated/">TideSDK documentation</a> site was used by more than 18,000 unique visitors with more than 228,000 pageviews.</p>

<p>Our communications channels have also expanded substantially with our growth. This includes an increase of more than 30% in <a href="http://www.twitter.com/tidesdk">Twitter</a> followers (as we moved beyond 1,600 followers), a 200% increase in <a href="https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/">GitHub</a> stars to 925 and greater than a 25% increase in our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tidesdk">mailing list</a> to more than 300 subscribers since Jan 1st.</p>

<p>There are currently more than <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tidesdk">160 topics on Stackoverflow</a> under the TideSDK tag and our mailing list has more than 150 topics of discussion on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tidesdk">Google Groups</a>. We appreciate these strong measures of support.</p>

<p>Code quality for TideSDK-1.3.1 beta has been very good. Users have been forthcoming with issues documented in our <a href="https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/issues">issue tracker</a> on Github for the beta code. In general, we’ve done a good job in managing feedback and resolving issues. A number of important fixes are currently in our develop branch for the upcoming 1.3.2-beta release. Beyond this, the bulk of the issues in our issue tracker are feature requests. From our users, HTML5 compliance and WebKit upgrades were top of mind. In our previous release, we envisioned a sequence of 1.3.x releases to culminate in a 1.4.0 release. The speed at which we get there is also in your hands.</p>

<h3>The <s>bad</s> sad numbers</h3>

<p>Many users may be aware that TideSDK became an affiliate project with the non-profit Software in the Public Interest (SPI). The core reason for this move last year was to ensure the sustainability and survival of the software. To operate a project of the size and scope of TideSDK requires substantial human and financial resources.</p>

<p>Strong efforts and months of preparation were undertaken to get TideSDK into a position to accept donations under a proper legal entity.</p>

<p>In the last six months revenues from donations totalled less than $300. If you are one of the handful developers that donated, we sincerely appreciate your contribution. Sadly we can’t understand why so few of our users are donating. We understand most people cannot contribute to the code directly, but demonstrating support by donating funds (to ensure progress by the project’s developers) is something each user can and should consider.</p>

<p>We’ve done our best to remind people that donations are needed to focus time on the project. For example, each download of TideSDK is met with a “call to action” button for donation and additional donation possibilities are integrated into our documentation site. We’ve given substantial time before reporting on revenues so that an accurate assessment can be presented to you.
Our funds are currently being used for license keys for our development servers thus far. Records of donations to TideSDK are publicly disclosed in monthly meeting minutes of <a href="http://spi-inc.org">SPI</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there has not been any corporate contribution of funds to TideSDK to date that could be channelled to development. Despite this, we wish to thank our faithful partners once again. We’re so happy to have you on board.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the financial results are sadly not in line with our expectations. We are disappointed and still cannot understand the disparity between donations and TideSDK uptake and usage. Needless to say, changes are needed to ensure progress on the project. If you use TideSDK or find the software useful in your business or development, we urge you to contribute funds for its success if you cannot contribute code or time.</p>
