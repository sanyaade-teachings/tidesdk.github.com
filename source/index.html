              <p><b>TideSDK</b> (<i>formerly Titanium Desktop</i>) is a remarkable project inherited from Appcelerator. It is now managed as community open source project by group dedicated to the availability of this unique solution.
            <br><br>
              The ability to deploy a Webkit-based desktop application across all <b>three major desktop operating systems</b>, with privileged access to native APIs, has empowered web developers to escape the browser and deliver rich, "always on" desktop apps.
            <br><br>  
              Users create applications using familiar <b>HTML5, JavaScript and CSS</b> technologies. Beyond this, the unique support for <b>Python, PHP and Ruby</b> extend the capabilities of <b>TideSDK</b> beyond the realm of any competitive framework. Further, our plans include the expansion and extension <b>TideSDK</b>'s API's for even better, more complex, and reliable user experiences on the desktop as we move forward.

                TideSDK is all about discovering that you're not just a web developer. You have the tools and skills for desktop development without knowing it. While we make every effort to make it easy for you to be productive, you will quickly learn it is possible to build highly sophisticated apps using TideSDK's capabilities. These are revealed in our support documentation and resources. The following is a short list of that spans development to deployment. A more extensive list of resources to availabassist you is available on our <a href="https://github.com/TideSDK/TideSDK/wiki">wiki</a>.

              </ul>
              You may download the related API Documentation here.<br><br>
              To install, you’ll want to download the appropriate distribution above and then extract into your Titanium directory.<br><br>
              For example, on OSX, your Titanium directory will be under either /Library/Application Support/Titanium or~/Library/Appcelerator Support/Titanium<br><br>
              On Linux ~/.titanium<br><br>
              On Windows 7 C:\ProgramData\Titanium and on Windows XP C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Titanium<br><br>
              Once you locate your Titanium directory, extract the zip file into this directory. The zip file will expand the contents and create/overlay some new directories for 1.2.0-RC4.<br><br>
              NOTE for OSX users who use Safari to download: Safari by default will auto uncompress your downloads, how handy. However, if you have a directory named desktopsdk, your extracted directory will be renamed.<br><br>
              Now, you’ll need to restart Titanium Studio to pick up the new release. Once restarted, remember to change your application SDK version and then click the ‘Save’ button.<br><br>
              You should now be able to test with the release candidate software.
